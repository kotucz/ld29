Ludum Dare 29 Game - created with LibGDX

http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&uid=18194

You control swarm of ant creatures. 
Their purpose is to feed the queen and replicate. 
Ants have one common mind - so they behave all the same if possible. 
Ants can walk, climb (when facing wall), dig and carry one object.
The queen cannot move, but it can spawn new ant when fed properly (leaves are best nutrient).
Each consumed leaf will give you additional ant to your colony. The more ant the better. No victory condition - only fun.

Controls: 
WASD or arrows - move 
F or spacebar - dig/take/drop/feed

Created using: 
Java + LibGDX, IntelliJ IDEA, GIMP
